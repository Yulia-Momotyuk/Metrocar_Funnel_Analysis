- **Platform performance:** Which platform (iOS, Android, Web) shows better conversion and retention?  
- **Age segmentation:** Which age groups are the primary drivers of activity and revenue?  
- **Dynamic pricing:** When do demand peaks occur and how best to implement surge pricing?  
- **Feedback collection:** Why do so few users leave reviews, and how can this be improved?
