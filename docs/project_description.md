# Project Description

## Introduction

Metrocar is a fast-growing digital ride-hailing platform connecting drivers and users through a mobile app. As of the analysis date, Metrocar has over 23,000 users and has processed more than 385,000 rides. This project aims to analyze the ride funnel and user behavior to identify bottlenecks and optimize user retention.

## Objectives

- Analyze the user journey from app download through to post-ride feedback submission.
- Identify stages with the highest drop-off rates in the funnel.
- Segment users by platform (iOS, Android, Web) and age groups to find key customer segments.
- Explore demand peak times to inform dynamic pricing (surge pricing) strategies.
- Understand why few users leave reviews and how feedback collection can be improved.

## Business Context

In a highly competitive mobile transportation market, efficient user acquisition and retention funnels are critical for scaling the business. Understanding where users drop off and which segments drive revenue supports better strategic decisions in marketing, product development, and pricing.

## Data Sources

- User activity and ride transaction logs stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- Exported query results saved as CSV files.
- Tableau dashboards used for interactive visualization and segmentation.

## Methodology

- Data extraction and transformation were performed using SQL (PostgreSQL).
- Intermediate aggregation and data validation were conducted in Excel.
- Interactive dashboards were created in Tableau to visualize funnels, segmentation, and key metrics.

## Key Metrics

- Conversion rates between funnel stages (% from previous stage).
- Overall funnel depth (% from initial stage).
- Platform-wise and age-group performance metrics.
- Demand peak hours and related surge pricing opportunities.

## Workflow

1. Extract relevant data using SQL queries to build user and ride funnels.
2. Export query results into CSV files for further analysis.
3. Perform intermediate data validation and aggregation in Excel.
4. Build Tableau dashboards for visualization and interactive filtering.
5. Document findings and formulate business recommendations.

## Expected Outcomes

- Identification of critical drop-off points in the user journey.
- Insights into platform and demographic segments with the highest engagement and revenue.
- Recommendations to improve user retention, feedback collection, and pricing strategies.

## Limitations

- Analysis is limited to available user and ride data at the time of study.
- Feedback data may be biased due to low review submission rates.
